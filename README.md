Update: the `Dockerfile` in folder `contrib` creates a standalone image, that works via
the associated `contrib/myvim.sh` to provide C/C++ and Python language-server-based
navigation/autocompletion WITHOUT external network access. It was the only way I could
see to trust these node/npm-based things.

These are my VIM settings, mostly targeting development with C, C++ and Python.
I wrote a blog post about them [here](https://www.thanassis.space/myvim.html).

Here is a [Vimeo-hosted video](http://vimeo.com/37875339) showing some of
the things I can do when I work in C or C++.

I use a small number of plugins, and did some minor customization for
keyboard shortcuts. The plugins are maintained with pathogen, and
are placed under bundle/ via Git submodules (so I always have the latest
plugin versions).

Installation
-------------

In any new machine/account I need to work on, I clone from the repository:

    cd
    git clone --no-recurse-submodules https://github.com/ttsiodras/dotvim .vim
    cd .vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    git submodule foreach --recursive git reset --hard
    cd ..
    ln -s .vim/.vimrc

I therefore use the same VIM environment in all my machines.

UPDATE, 2025/May: I added a Dockerized folder where you just issue "make"
and get a nice Docker image that DOESNT ALLOW NETWORK ACCESS; you then use
Dockerized/myvim.sh and edit as you normally would, with fully operational
language servers for C/C++/Python; but WITHOUT ANY NETWORK ACCESS.

Translation: yeah, I need language servers - but that doesn't mean I should
be trusting them :-)

For C/C++ development
---------------------

I first create /usr/include/tags:

    (become root via su/sudo)
    cd /usr/include
    ctags -R --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q .

My .vimrc is set to use these, as well as any local "tags" I build
in my project-specific Makefiles:

    set tags+=/usr/include/tags

I use [clang complete](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3302)
  to get Intellisense-like autocompletion (see an example session recorded
in this [Vimeo-hosted video](http://vimeo.com/37875339)).

The 'A' plugin allows me to quickly switch between .h/c{c,pp} with ':A'

Pressing 'K' shows manpages on the symbol under the cursor in an "inner window"
(which allows me to copy/paste).
I then quickly close the manpage "window" with Ctrl-F12.

F8 shows taglists (macros/types/variables/functions/classes).

For Python development
----------------------

F7 is mapped to invoke flake8 (install it with: "pip install flake8") to get
static analysis error reports from "pyflakes" and style issues from "pep8",
navigating from error to error in the usual way (":cn", ":cp") - which is
mapped to F4.

I've also added a "screen" based SLIME-like environment. Here's a
[demonstration of the process on Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/37894593).

Basically, spawn a screen session via...

    screen -c python.screenrc

(or "python.screenrc.for.ArchLinux" if your screen doesn't support the
"split -v" command) and you will get two screen windows: one with a VIM,
one with a python instance. Navigate to whatever function/class you want
in VIM, and hit Ctrl-c Ctrl-c (i.e. Ctrl-c twice). This will send
the function/class to the running python instance.

You can then switch between VIM and python 'windows' via Alt-1,
and abort it all via Alt-0.

For XML
-------
F7 is mapped to SAXCount (the Xerces XML validator) and F4 navigates
from each error (reported by SAXCount) to the next.

Here's a [blog post](https://www.thanassis.space/regexp.html) I wrote about using these.

Generic stuff
-------------

I've mapped:

- NERDTreeToggle to F10, for direct access to "file manager" interface
- TAB and Shift-TAB (in normal mode) cycle buffers
- Ctrl-cursors to navigate windows (or create them, if missing)
- Ctrl-L to clear search results (hate seeing yellow stuff after search)
- Ctrl-F12 to quickly close "window" (buffer)
- I've also installed the easymotion plugin, so I can navigate to any place in the screen
  with a simple \\\\w followed by a character. Amazing plugin.

Am I insane to use VIM?
-----------------------
[No,](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html) I am [not](https://www.thanassis.space/myvim.html).

How to add more plugins?
------------------------
Just...
    git submodule add https://.... bundle/something

How to uninstall a plugin?
--------------------------
Just...
    git submodule deinit bundle/something
    git rm bundle/something
    git rm --cached bundle/something
    rm -rf .git/modules/bundle/something
